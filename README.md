# Cool Reads

The "Cool Reads" project aims to create a web application that allows users to gather, organize, and share their reading recommendations from across the internet. The Product Owner envisions a platform where users can easily save and categorize interesting articles, blog posts, tutorials, or news articles they come across during their online reading. They should be able to share their curated collection with others and, importantly, manage their reading recommendations efficiently.
