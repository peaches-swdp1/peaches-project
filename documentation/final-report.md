## Sprint 1
### Challenges and solutions
We had some problems with Eclipse for one of the team members, 
but they were fixed by moving to a different IDE. 
The code related tasks were easy for the first sprint, so we didn't have many issues.

We managed do most of the tasks early in the sprint, so we didn't have much communication trouble. 

## Sprint 2
### Challenges and solutions
There were some problems migrating the application frontend to React, however, that was fixed 
rather quickly. The other issue we ran into was that the deployment wasn't up to date by the end of the Sprint, which was
due too poor communication.

This Sprint the biggest challenge was communication. We were using Teams for communicating,
however, Teams wasn't always sending notifications to everyone. As a result, some questions were
left unanswered longer than they should have been. We managed to solve this problem
by creating a WhatsApp group instead of a Teams group. This worked way better moving forward 
we didn't have major communication problems.

## Sprint 3
### Challenges and solutions
Sprint 3 went quite smoothly. The switch from Teams to WhatsApp proved to be a great idea.

The biggest issue was that everyone was busy with other courses during Sprint 3 week, because it is the last week of classes.
Due to that we finished very close to the deadline which was not ideal.

## Successes and Areas of Improvement
We managed to do everything on time and divide the work quite evenly. Additionally, 
everyone did their part very well.

Areas of improvement include communication. The communication wasn't perfect and we could have
communicated more to each other about problems we were facing and when each member will be able to finish their part.
We could have also finished earlier, which would have been better.

## Learning outcomes
We learned how to connect backend to the React frontend. This was quite nice as the backend and frontend courses
focus on each area separately. It was great to learn how to combine the knowledge together.

We also learned how Scrum is used in practice and not just in theory. It was very interesting to
work in such a manner. 

There is nothing that felt irrelevant. Everything was well structured and the material presented was of good quality.
